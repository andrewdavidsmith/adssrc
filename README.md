Some code I wrote -- and occasionally use.

collapsebed
===========

This program takes a set of genomic intervals, and identifies each maximal
contiguous sub-iterval that overlaps a fixed number of the input intervals.
Then the set of sub-intervals overlapping more than some specified number
of the original intervals are reported.
