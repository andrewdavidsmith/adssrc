  ABOUT NEWICK FORMAT
  -------------------

  The following should all be legal, according to wikipedia.

  (,,(,));                               no nodes are named
  (A,B,(C,D));                           leaf nodes are named
  (A,B,(C,D)E)F;                         all nodes are named
  (:0.1,:0.2,(:0.3,:0.4):0.5);           all but root node have a distance to parent
  (:0.1,:0.2,(:0.3,:0.4):0.5):0.0;       all have a distance to parent
  (A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4):0.5);       distances and leaf names (popular)
  (A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)F;     distances and all names
  ((B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)F:0.1)A;    a tree rooted on a leaf node (rare)

  ========================================================================

  (1) It seems like a tree always ends in a semicolon
  (2) Trees need not be binary, but usually are ***
  (3) Since the code needs to have uniform nodes, we will always have
      a distance, even for the root, but this will be 0.0
  (4) The parsing will look for commas, but not within parentheses
  (5) No whitespace will be allowed. It will be removed initially
  (6) There is a question of whether to allow commas or colons inside
      names, for example by using quotes around the names or trying to
      parse intelligently
  (7) Leaves should have proper names as unique identifiers, if not given in the
      newick string, we should name them properly.
  (8) Search for nearest common ancestor will return the ancestor's name, for now.
